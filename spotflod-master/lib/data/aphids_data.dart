  static const String information = """
      Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that can cause damage to cotton plants by feeding on the sap of the leaves, stems, and other plant parts. When aphids feed on cotton leaves, they can cause several different types of damage, including:
1.	Stunting and yellowing of leaves: Aphids can cause leaves to become stunted, curled, and yellowed, which can reduce the overall health of the cotton plant.
2.	Honeydew secretion: Aphids excrete a sugary substance called honeydew, which can coat the leaves of the cotton plant and create a sticky surface. This can interfere with the plant's ability to photosynthesize and can also attract other pests such as ants.
3.	Transmission of diseases: Some species of aphids can transmit plant diseases, such as cotton leaf curl virus and cotton blue disease, which can further damage the cotton plant.""";
