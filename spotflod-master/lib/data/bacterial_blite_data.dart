  Cotton bacterial blight is a bacterial disease that can infect cotton plants and is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum. When this bacterium infects cotton leaves, it can cause a variety of symptoms, including:
1.	Angular leaf spots: The primary symptom of cotton bacterial blight is the appearance of angular leaf spots on the leaves of infected plants. These spots are typically dark brown and have a yellow halo around them.
2.	Leaf blight and defoliation: As the bacterial infection progresses, the leaves of infected plants may begin to exhibit blight symptoms, and the plant may experience significant defoliation.
3.	Reduced photosynthesis: Cotton plants infected with bacterial blight may exhibit reduced photosynthetic activity, which can further reduce their growth and yield.
4.	Boll rot: In some cases, cotton bacterial blight can also infect cotton bolls, causing them to rot and reducing the overall quality of the cotton produced.""";
