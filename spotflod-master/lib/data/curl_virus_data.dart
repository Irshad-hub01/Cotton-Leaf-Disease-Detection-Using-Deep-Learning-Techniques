  Cotton leaf curl virus is a viral disease that can infect cotton plants, and it is transmitted by whiteflies. When cotton plants are infected with this virus, they can exhibit a variety of symptoms, including:
1.	Curling and puckering of leaves: One of the most common symptoms of cotton leaf curl virus is the curling and puckering of leaves. Infected leaves may also appear thickened and distorted.
2.	Yellowing and stunting: Infected cotton plants may exhibit yellowing and stunting, which can reduce the overall yield and quality of the cotton produced.
3.	Reduced photosynthesis: Cotton plants infected with the leaf curl virus may also exhibit reduced photosynthetic activity, which can further reduce their growth and yield.
4.	Deformation of bolls: In some cases, the leaf curl virus can also cause the deformation of cotton bolls, which can further reduce the quality of the cotton produced.""";
