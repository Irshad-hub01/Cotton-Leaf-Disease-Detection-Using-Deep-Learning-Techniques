  static const String information = """
  Fusarium wilt is a fungal disease that can infect cotton plants and is caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. When this fungus infects cotton plants, it can cause a variety of symptoms, including:
1.	Yellowing and wilting: One of the most common symptoms of Fusarium wilt is the yellowing and wilting of leaves. Infected plants may also exhibit stunted growth.
2.	Root rot: Fusarium wilt can also cause root rot, which can further weaken the plant and make it more susceptible to other pests and diseases.
3.	Vascular discoloration: Infected cotton plants may exhibit discoloration of the vascular tissue, which can be seen by cutting open the stem of the plant.
4.	Reduced yield: Fusarium wilt can reduce the overall yield and quality of the cotton produced, as infected plants may produce fewer bolls and smaller, lower-quality cotton fibers.""";
